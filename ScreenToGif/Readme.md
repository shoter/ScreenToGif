# ScreenToGif  

This is the current project of ScreenToGif.  

_VS 2017 and .Net 4.6.1 or newer required._


## What's new? (Version 2.10)

• The app and the installer are now digitally signed! You should see my name (Nicke Manarin) on the properties of the files.   
• Redesigned screen/window/area selection experience on the new recorder.  
• The app will ask before closing if there's anything being edited.  
• Added the option saving the project while saving a gif (by using the same filename).  

### Fixed:

♦ For some users, clicking to stop the recording was crashing the recorder.  
♦ The "Insert recording" action was ignoring the option of using the new recorder UI.  
♦ Added support for images with ".jpeg" extension (same as .jpg that is supported already).  
♦ The app now remembers the last used position of the Watermark.  
♦ Pressing Esc wasn't closing the panel when the keyboard focus was inside the Free Drawing and Cinemagraph elements.
